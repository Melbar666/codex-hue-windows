# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please keep the project small, dependency-light, and
safe for local smart-home use.

1. Fork the repository and create a focused branch.
2. Install a development copy with `python -m pip install -e .`.
3. Run `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`.
4. Add tests for behavior changes and update the README when commands change.
5. Open a pull request explaining the behavior and how it was tested.

Never commit a real Hue username, Bridge address, certificate fingerprint,
Codex hooks file, log, or state snapshot. Tests should use temporary directories
and fake clients. Do not run integration tests against another person's lights
without their permission.
